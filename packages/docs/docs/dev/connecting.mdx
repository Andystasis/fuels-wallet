# Connecting

## Checking if a Connector is available

Before doing others actions the Application can check if the user has a Wallet installed.
This is not required but it's a good practice to provide a better experience to the user.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/CheckWallet.tsx"
  commentBlock="checkWallet"
/>

As a user can install a wallet, you can listen for changes on the status of the `currentConnector`.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/CheckWallet.tsx"
  commentBlock="watchWallet"
/>

<Examples.CheckWallet />

You can learn more about connectors and how they work to allow mutiple wallet's [here](./connectors)

## Requesting a Connection

Before any actions from the user starts the user needs to authorize the connection this is done by calling the method `connect()`. Which will start the connection flow in the user's Wallet,
if the user has more Accounts them what is available to the current connection.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/Connect.tsx"
  commentBlock="connect"
/>

<Examples.Connect />

## Checking connection state

To check if the user's wallet is already connected, you can use the `isConnected()` method.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/CheckConnection.tsx"
  commentBlock="checkConnection"
/>

<Examples.CheckConnection />

## Watching connection state

As a user can add or remove a connection, directly inside the wallet. We also recommend
to your application to also listen for the connection state changes, by using the event listener.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/CheckConnection.tsx"
  commentBlock="watchConnection"
/>

## Removing connection

In some cases a application may want to provide a experience for the user to remove the connection.
in this cases you can use the `disconnect()` method.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/Disconnect.tsx"
  commentBlock="disconnect"
/>

<Examples.Disconnect />

## Using React Hooks

### Requesting a Connection

In React Application you can levarage our ready to use hooks, that include tracking of events.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/hooks/ConnectHook.tsx"
  commentBlock="connect"
/>

<Examples.ConnectHook />

### Removing connection

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/hooks/DisconnectHook.tsx"
  commentBlock="disconnect"
/>

<Examples.DisconnectHook />

### Checking connection state

All hooks implement validations to ensure the state is sync, using the methods and events available from the SDK.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/connecting/hooks/ConnectHook.tsx"
  commentBlock="checkConnection"
/>
