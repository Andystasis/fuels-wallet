# API Reference

## Methods

## Listing connectors

`connectors(): Promise<Array<FuelConnector>>`<br />
Return connectors with availability metadata.

## Has connector

`hasConnector(connectorName?: string | FuelConnector): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Check if any connector is available or, if a connector is provided, check whether it is available.

## Current connector

`currentConnector(): FuelConnector`<br />
Return the current selected connector.

## Get connector

`getConnector(connectorName: string): FuelConnector`<br />
Return the connector with the given name.

## Selecting connector

`selectConnector(connectorName: string): Promise<boolean>` <br />
This method will check if the desired connector is installed. If it is not detected in 1 second, the method throws an error.

## Version

`version(): Promise<string>`<br />
Return the current version of the Wallet and Network supported.

## Connect

`connect(): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request permission to start a connection between the project and the wallet. Return the connection state.

## Disconnect

`disconnect(): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Disconnect your project from the wallet. Return the connection state.

## Get connection status

`isConnected(): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Return the state of the application connection.

## List accounts

`accounts(): Promise<Array<string>>`<br />
Return the accounts authorized for the current connection.

## Current account

`currentAccount(): Promise<string | null>`<br />
Return the current account being used in the wallet application.
If the account selected is not authorized for the connection, returns null.

## List networks

`networks(): Promise<Array<Network>>`<br />
Return the list of networks in the current wallet.

## Current network

`currentNetwork(): Promise<Network>`<br />
Return the current network being used in the wallet application.

## Select network

`selectNetwork(url: string): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request the user to switch to a different network. Return true if success or false it fails.

## Add network

`addNetwork(url: string): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request the user to add a new network. Return true if success or false it fails.

## List assets

`assets(): Promise<Array<Asset>>`<br />
Return the list of assets in the current wallet.

## Add asset

`addAsset(asset: Asset): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request the user to add metadata for an asset to the wallet.

## Add assets

`addAssets(asset: Asset[]): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Request the user to add metadata for multiple assets to the wallet at once.

## Get ABI

`getABI(contractId: string): Promise<JsonAbi>`<br />
Return the ABI of the given contractId, or null if not found.

## Has ABI

`hasABI(contractId: string): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Return a boolean indicating if the ABI for the given contractId is found.

## Add ABI

`addAbi(abiMap: AbiMap): Promise<boolean>`<br />
Add the ABI to the user's wallet.

## Request signature message

`async signMessage(address: string, message: string): Promise<string>`<br />
Request a message signature for one specific account

### Send transaction

`async sendTransaction(address: string, transaction: TransactionRequestLike): Promise<string>`<br />
Request a specific user account to send a transaction.

## Get Wallet

`getWallet(address: string | AbstractAddress, provider?: FuelWalletProvider): Promise<FuelWalletLocked>`<br />
Return a `FuelWalletLocked` instance, which can be used for contracts, transfers, and other interactions.

## Unsubscribe all

`unsubscribe(): void`<br />
Remove all open listeners. This is useful when you want to dispose of the Fuel instance and avoid memory leaks.

## Clean

`clean(): void`<br />
Clean the storage used by the Fuel SDK, which is utilized to keep track of the selected connector.

## Destory

`destroy(): void`<br />
Removes all listeners and cleans the storage.

## Events

Fuel emits events when certain actions occur. These events can be listened to by using the `on` method.

The events API follows the native Node.js `EventEmitter` enabling, `on`, `once`, and `off`.
The events enum `FuelWalletEvents` can be imported from the `@fuel-wallet/sdk` package.

### Usage

The `fuel` object has an `events` property which is an enum of all the events that can be listened to. <br />
The `on` method takes two arguments, the event name and a callback function. The callback function receives data associated with the event.

```ts
fuel.on(fuel.events.connection, (connectionState) => {
  console.log(connectionState);
});
```

### Events

| Event              | Trigger                   | Params                 |
