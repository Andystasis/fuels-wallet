# Getting Started

The Fuel Wallet SDK works as connection managers between you DApp and other Wallet compatible with the Fuel Network. This
package ensures that you can connector to Fuel Wallet, but also with any other wallet, using a unified API.

If you are using **React** jump to the [React section](./#using-react).

## Installation

To start integrate the Fuel Wallet SDK on your DApp, you first need to install the packages, `@fuel-wallet/sdk` and `fuels`.

```bash
npm install @fuel-wallet/sdk fuels
```

The installation requires `fuels` sdk also, as it is used to communicate with the Fuel Network, and provides
a set of utilities required to interact with Contracts on the Fuel Network.

## Example

```ts
import { Fuel } from '@fuel-wallet/sdk';

const fuel = new Fuel();

await fuel.connect();
```

## Using React

Fuel Wallet SDK also provides a set of React hooks and a UI for working with it connectors without,
the need for manually create a UI, for it.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @fuel-wallet/react fuels
```

### Example

#### Setup

Wrap your application with the provider `FuelConnectProvider`.

```tsx
import { FuelProvider } from '@fuel-wallet/react';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <FuelProvider>
      <App />
    </FuelProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Alternativily you can use just the `FuelProvider`, if you don't want to use the provided UI.

#### Usage

```ts
import { useConnectUI } from '@fuel-wallet/react';
const { connect, isConnecting } = useConnectUI();

<button onClick={connect}>
  {isConnecting ? 'Connecting...' : 'Connect'}
</button>
```
